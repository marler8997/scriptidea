This directory contains files copied from https://github.com/kokke/tiny-regex-c. However, I've made a change to the library so I'm pulling the files from my fork: https://github.com/marler8997/tiny-regex-c.

Running the `update` stitch script will clone and copy the sources used.

Modify the `sha` in the `update` script to change which version of the repo the files are copied from.

Note that in the final implementation, the regex logic should be compiled all the way to machine code, the original regex strings should be long gone.
