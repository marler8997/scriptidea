This directory contains files copied from https://github.com/kokke/tiny-regex-c. However, I've made extensive changes to it which can be found at my fork: https://github.com/marler8997/tiny-regex-c

Running the `update` stitch script will clone and copy the source files that stitch uses.

Modify the `sha` in the `update` script to change which version of the repo the files are copied from.
